## 🔧 Required Setup

### 1. Create Environment File

Create a `.env.local` file in your project root:

```env
NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=your-secret-key-here-change-this-in-production
```

### 2. Ensure Database is Running

Make sure your SQL Server database is accessible with the credentials in `utils/database.js`

### 3. Verify User Table

Ensure your `User_mst` table exists with the correct structure as shown in `AUTH_SETUP.md`

## 🚀 Test the Setup

1. Start your development server: `npm run dev`
2. Navigate to `http://localhost:3000/login`
3. Try logging in with valid database credentials
4. You should be redirected to `/employees` on success

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

If you still see the "useAuth must be used within an AuthProvider" error:

1. Clear your browser cache
2. Restart the development server
3. Check the browser console for any other errors

The authentication system is now fully integrated with NextAuth! 🎉
